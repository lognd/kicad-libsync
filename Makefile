# T-3400: this Makefile intentionally does NOT ship format/lint/typecheck/
# test/coverage/check targets. This is a frob-enabled project (see
# frob.toml) and frob IS the interface for those workflows, not a make
# wrapper around it -- use the commands below directly:
#
#   frob format     ruff check --fix + ruff format
#   frob check      the aggregate gate (ruff, ty, frob cycle/dup/arch/...)
#   frob test       select and run tests for the touched set (or --all)
#   frob coverage   refresh coverage.xml / the coverage stamp
#
# Only bootstrap (install, below) and build/publish (clean, upload) stay
# here: bootstrap cannot be a frob subcommand because it installs frob's
# own prerequisites, and clean/upload carry real project-specific logic
# frob has no equivalent for.
