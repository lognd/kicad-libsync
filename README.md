# kicad-libsync

TODO: one-sentence description of what this project does.

## Quick start

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env   # fill in real values; .env is gitignored
frob check              # lint + typecheck + test + the full frob gate
```

## Development

This is a frob-enabled project: `frob <verb>` is the interface, not a
`make` wrapper around it.

```bash
frob test        # select and run tests for the touched set (or --all)
frob format       # ruff check --fix + ruff format
frob coverage     # refresh coverage.xml / the coverage stamp
frob check        # the aggregate gate: ruff, ty, frob cycle/dup/arch/...
```

`make install`/`make clean`/`make upload` remain (bootstrap and
build/publish -- see the Makefile).
