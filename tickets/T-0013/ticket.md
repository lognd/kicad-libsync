The deferred post-land unscoped sweep (T-1684) for an unattributed source (sweep spawned by T-0006) at commit dc6826efba6b6554bf7505d8ea916127f7c870ad found 2 new (rule, file) identit(ies) that were not present in the previous sweep's baseline.

T-1935: this is a count of DISTINCT (rule, file) IDENTITIES (1), not a raw finding count -- every finding sharing a (rule, file) pair collapses into ONE identity here (deliberately, so attribution and quarantine reason about "which files went red", not individual diagnostics). An independent re-measurement found 2 actual finding(s) across those 1 identit(ies).

New (rule, file) identit(ies) filed here:

- SELFAUDIT001  design

Attribution (T-1690, symbolic reachability over the verify queue's touched-symbol sets):

- SELFAUDIT001  design  -> UNATTRIBUTED (no batch commit's touched symbols reach this finding); candidate commits: []
- TEST006  tests/__init__.py  -> UNATTRIBUTED (no batch commit's touched symbols reach this finding); candidate commits: []

Under the rapid profile the sweep runs detached and files this ticket rather than reverting an already-published commit. Fix the errors, or -- if they are pre-existing residue the rolling baseline simply had not recorded yet -- close this ticket with that finding stated explicitly.

## Drop reason
- 2026-09-05: T-1983: auto-dropped by the deferred post-land sweep -- every (rule, file) identity this ticket named (SELFAUDIT001 design) is absent from a full unscoped `frob check --json` run that completed with no budget deferral and no failed/silent tool stage at T-0007's deferred sweep (T-2521: this drop only fires when that measurement itself completed -- no budget deferral, no failed/silent tool stage -- never on an unmeasured or partial run), i.e. no longer reproduces. If this is wrong (a flaky/incomplete measurement), re-file with `frob check --only <gate>` evidence attached.
