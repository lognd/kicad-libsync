The deferred post-land unscoped sweep (T-1684) for an unattributed source (sweep spawned by T-0007) at commit bb89398da5e63a23dd9205eeffc32765f2139269 found 2 new (rule, file) identit(ies) that were not present in the previous sweep's baseline.

T-1935: this is a count of DISTINCT (rule, file) IDENTITIES (1), not a raw finding count -- every finding sharing a (rule, file) pair collapses into ONE identity here (deliberately, so attribution and quarantine reason about "which files went red", not individual diagnostics). An independent re-measurement found 1 actual finding(s) across those 1 identit(ies).

New (rule, file) identit(ies) filed here:

- REF002  docs/design/registry/capability-via-ratchet.lock.json

Attribution (T-1690, symbolic reachability over the verify queue's touched-symbol sets):

- REF002  docs/design/registry/capability-via-ratchet.lock.json  -> UNATTRIBUTED (no batch commit's touched symbols reach this finding); candidate commits: []
- TEST006  tests/integration/test_watcher_state.py  -> attributed to T-0007 (commit bb89398da5e6, already closed/dropped -- filed below) via tests/integration/test_watcher_state.py::FIXTURES

Under the rapid profile the sweep runs detached and files this ticket rather than reverting an already-published commit. Fix the errors, or -- if they are pre-existing residue the rolling baseline simply had not recorded yet -- close this ticket with that finding stated explicitly.
